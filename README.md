Atom-RDC
========

Introduction
------------

The _Atom representation of Research Data Context_ (Atom-RDC) is a
format for representing metadata about research data.

Background
----------

The Atom-RDC format was  developed as part of an ANDS _Seeding
the Commons_ project and implemented in the UQ DataSpace system.

Instructions
------------

The specification is written in [Markdown] (see files under the _posts
subdirectory) and is converted to HTML using [Jekyll]. The main (and
only) GitHub branch is "gh-pages" because the purpose of this project
is to update the GitHub project pages.

To update the specification, create a new file under `_posts`
containing the new version. Do not modify the existing posts. Push the
changes to GitHub and it will automatically update the project pages
at <http://uq-eresearch-spec.github.com/atom-rdc>.
